# Interface Preview

This file serves as a placeholder for the interface preview image.

To add the actual image:

1. Save the interface screenshot as `interface-preview.png` in this directory
2. The image will automatically be displayed in the README.md

The image should show:

- Video player with church scene
- Timeline with thumbnails
- Control buttons (play, download, reset)
- Dark theme interface
