## README Image Display

2. **Ensure the filename** is exactly `interface-preview.png`
3. **The image will automatically display** in the README

### Alternative: Use GitHub Issues for Images

If you want to add the image quickly:

1. Create a GitHub issue
2. Drag and drop the image into the issue
3. Copy the image URL from the issue
4. Update the README.md with the new URL
